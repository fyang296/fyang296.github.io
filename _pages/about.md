My research interest lies at the forefront of Next-Generation Networks (6G and beyond), focusing on the synergy between Wireless Communications, Internet of Things (IoT), and Quantum Networking. I am particularly interested in leveraging AI in networking measurement and management to optimize resource allocation and enhance the reliability of large-scale infrastructures, such as Smart Grid Communications. By exploring graph-based representations and intelligent orchestration, I aim to develop resilient, high-capacity classical-quantum hybrid frameworks that address the evolving demands of security and connectivity in the future digital ecosystem.

Short Biography
======
I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison , where I also serve as a Research Assistant focusing on the intersection of wireless communications, AI-driven network management and next generation network. To date, I have authored several peer-reviewed publications in prestigious venues, including IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (TNSM) and Sensors. As the first author of one core study, I specialize in applying graph theory to solve complex network scheduling problems. My theoretical contributions include proposing the first approximation algorithm for dynamic Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) topologies. In addition to my first-author work, I have served as a co-author on several collaborative projects. Beyond academia, I have gained valuable industry experience as an Algorithm Development Intern, where I designed modular architectures and optimized task-offloading algorithms in integrated edge-cloud environments. I also actively contribute to the professional community as a reviewer for leading journals and conferences, including IEEE Communications Magazine, Transactions on Services Computing, and IPCCC.
